MagnoSens LLC
Revolutionizing Infrastructure Monitoring with Advanced Sensors

Our Technology
MagnoSens LLC is developing cutting-edge electromagnetic wave-guided sensors for real-time infrastructure monitoring. Our technology enables data-driven maintenance and rehabilitation planning for highways and bridges by providing real-time volume fraction analysis, including water content, solids, and voids.

Unlike conventional sensors that focus on single-property measurements, our solution integrates multi-parameter sensing, making it an ideal tool for quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) in new infrastructure construction.

Market Opportunity
Infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation remain a top priority in the U.S., with the Federal Highway Administration allocating billions for improvements. Our solution aligns with FHWAâ€™s Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Roadmap, addressing key industry challenges and offering a scalable solution for real-time structural health monitoring.

With over 46,000 structurally deficient bridges and a $786 billion investment gap in road maintenance, the demand for innovative sensor technology is growing rapidly.

Funding Needs
We have already applied for NSF SBIR funding to advance this technology and are using the same core physics solution to develop a shrinkage measurement device for concrete, for which we have applied to the USDOT SBIR program.

To complement these efforts, we are seeking pre-seed funding to accelerate sensor development and support key operational and pilot project planning needs that extend beyond our grant-funded research.

Our Team
Dr. Issa M. Issa - Founder & Principal Investigator

Dr. Issa has extensive expertise in civil engineering, electromagnetic sensing, and infrastructure monitoring. His research has contributed to developing innovative solutions for concrete shrinkage measurement and transportation infrastructure maintenance.

Collaborations
We are collaborating with Soil Monkey LLC for the manufacturing of our prototype.

We are working with Texas A&M University on our NSF SBIR project.

For the development of our shrinkage measurement device, we are partnering with Texas State University.
