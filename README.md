MagnoSens LLC is developing cutting-edge electromagnetic wave-guided sensors for real-time infrastructure monitoring. Our technology enables data-driven maintenance and rehabilitation planning for highways and bridges by providing real-time volume fraction analysis, including water content, solids, and voids.

Unlike conventional sensors that focus on single-property measurements, our solution integrates multi-parameter sensing, making it an ideal tool for quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) in new infrastructure construction.
