        <h2>Our Technology</h2>
        <p>MagnoSens LLC is developing cutting-edge electromagnetic wave-guided sensors for real-time infrastructure monitoring. Our technology enables data-driven maintenance and rehabilitation planning for highways and bridges by providing real-time volume fraction analysis, including water content, solids, and voids.</p>
        <p>Unlike conventional sensors that focus on single-property measurements, our solution integrates multi-parameter sensing, making it an ideal tool for quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) in new infrastructure construction.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="market">
        <h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
        <p>Infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation remain a top priority in the U.S., with the Federal Highway Administration allocating billions for improvements. Our solution aligns with FHWAâ€™s Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Roadmap, addressing key industry challenges and offering a scalable solution for real-time structural health monitoring.</p>
        <p>With over 46,000 structurally deficient bridges and a $786 billion investment gap in road maintenance, the demand for innovative sensor technology is growing rapidly.</p>

    <section id="funding">
        <h2>Funding Needs</h2>
        <p>We have already applied for <strong>NSF SBIR</strong> funding to advance this technology and are using the same core physics solution to develop a shrinkage measurement device for concrete, for which we have applied to the <strong>USDOT SBIR</strong> program.</p>
        <p>To complement these efforts, we are seeking <strong>pre-seed funding</strong> to accelerate sensor development and support key operational and pilot project planning needs that extend beyond our grant-funded research.</p>
